## Codebase

### Technologies

With the ground rules out of the way, let's talk about the coarse architecture of this mono repo:

Here is a list of all the big technologies we use:

## Project Setup

### First time setup

### FRONTEND
The first step to running PF locally is downloading the code by cloning the repository:

```sh

git clone https://github.com/akashdey23/react_pf.git
```

### Installation

React_PF has a single installation step:

- **Install the dependencies**:

```sh

cd react_pf
npm install
npm start

```

You've now finished installing everything! Let's start :100:

Ps: if you're getting error installing the dependencies, try --force command along with npm install. For example

```sh

npm install --force

```

Now you're ready to run the app locally and sign into your local instance!
